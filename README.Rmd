Child acute malnutrition can lead to death if not identified and treated in time. Driven by a combination of diverse factors, it often exhibits spatial variation. The levels of acute malnutrition are commonly measured through surveys that are representative of the area of interest. These survey results are then used to inform programme responses — to find and treat affected children. To that end, programme managers require actionable insights on where acute malnutrition is most prevalent. This is essential for prioritising interventions, especially when resources are limited. 

`wowi` - an expression meaning *“where”* in Elómwè, a local language spoken in central-northern Mozambique - provides convenient utilities for this purpose. It identifies locations across the survey area where acute malnutrition is significantly high (hotspots) or low (coldspots), and unlikely to be due to chance alone.  

`wowi` is a wrapper package built on top of the [`rsatscan`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsatscan/index.html) package, which enables the use of the [`SaTScan`](https://www.satscan.org) software from within R. While `rsatscan` provides general-purpose functionality, wowi was specifically made for acute malnutrition analysis, tailoring the tools to the needs of nutrition-focused spatial investigations. 

To use `wowi`, you must have SaTScan installed on your machine, along with the [`mwana`](https://nutriverse.io/mwana/dev/) R package for preprocessing anthropometric data.

## Installation  

`wowi` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed through:
```{r installation, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pak::pak(pkg = "nutspatial/wowi")
```

## What does `wowi` do? 

It takes a dataset with GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), scans for clusters of acute malnutrition—either high or low, depending on the user’s specification—across the survey area, and returns three main outputs: (1) an interactive HTML map displaying the detected clusters (previewed below); (2) a .txt file containing the results; and (3) a table with summary statistics and metadata parsed from the .txt file.

This package is particularly handy when working with datasets that span multiple areas or administrative units, enabling consistent, area-wise detection of hotspots and coldspots. It also generates additional GIS-based files (e.g., shapefiles), which can be useful for further geospatial manipulation or integration into other mapping workflows.

### Shiny App  

To use the included Shiny App, run the following function in R: 

```r
ww_run_app()
```

This will initiate the package's Shiny App using the installed web browser 
on machine.

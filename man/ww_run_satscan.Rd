\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame object that has been wrangled using
\verb{mwana::mw_wrangle_*()} functions.}

\item{filename}{Optional. Used only in single-area analysis.
Used to identify the analysis area. The string should be quoted.}

\item{dir}{A quoted string of the folder or directory in which the files
should be saved.}

\item{params_dir}{A quoted string of the folder or directory where the
parameters file (produced by this function) should be saved.
Defaults to the same value as \code{dir}.}

\item{sslocation}{A quoted string indicating the path to the SaTScan
GUI installation. This varies by operating system (OS). For macOS, it is
typically \code{"/Applications/SaTScan.app/Contents/app"}; for Windows,
\code{"C:/Program Files/SaTScan"}.}

\item{ssbatchfilename}{A quoted string specifying the SaTScan batch file
name. For macOS, use \code{"satscan"}; for Windows, use \code{"SaTScanBatch64"}.}

\item{satscan_version}{A quoted string indicating the version of SaTScan
installed on the user's computer. See \code{\link[=ww_configure_satscan]{ww_configure_satscan()}} for details.}

\item{.by_area}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, area-wise scan is done. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{.scan_for}{A quoted string indicating the type of clusters to scan for.
To scan for high-rate clusters only, set \code{.scan_for = "high-rates"}.
To scan for both high and low rates, set \code{.scan_for = "high-low-rates"}.}

\item{.gam_based}{A quoted string indicating the criterion used to define acute
malnutrition. This is used to identify the right vector where flagged values
are identified, and for which should be excluded from the analysis. Default
is \code{wfhz}.}

\item{latitude}{Geographical coordinates. An unquoted string for the variable
containing the x-axis, also known as latitude (east-west direction). The
variable must be named "latitude".}

\item{longitude}{Geographical coordinates. An unquoted string for the variable
containing the y-axis, also know as longitude (north-south direction). The
variable must be named "longitude".}

\item{area}{An unquoted string for the variable containing the analysis areas
for iteration.}

\item{cleanup}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, deletes all SaTScan output files from
the directory after the function runs.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, displays the SaTScan results in the R
console as if run in batch mode. This is especially useful if the scan
takes a long time.}
}
\value{
A set of SaTScan output files, saved in the specified directory. The full
file names depend on the \code{filename} argument:
\itemize{
\item \code{filename.txt}: A plain-text summary of the results.
\item \code{filename.clustermap.html}: An interactive HTML map showing detected
clusters, with red bubbles for high-rate clusters and blue for low-rate clusters.
\item Shapefiles: A collection of spatial files suitable for use in GIS software.
}
}
\description{
Detect statistically significant spatial clusters of acute malnutrition rates,
including high-only or high-and-low clusters. \code{ww_run_satscan()} is a wrapper
function that interacts with the SaTScan GUI via the \code{{rsatscan}} package.
It internally calls both \code{\link[=ww_wrangle_data]{ww_wrangle_data()}} and \code{\link[=ww_configure_satscan]{ww_configure_satscan()}},
allowing users to skip these two steps in the workflow and instead call
\code{ww_run_satscan()} directly.
}
\details{
The geographical coordinates must be provided as latitude and longitude values.
If the input data uses different variable names, they must be renamed accordingly;
otherwise, the analysis will be aborted. Latitude corresponds to the X-axis
(east-west direction), and longitude the to X-axis (north-south direction).
